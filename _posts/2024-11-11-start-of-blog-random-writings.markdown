So ... why do I start the blog?

That's a kinda-long-but-not-so-long story. Life has been crazy for me these two months. Homework, college essay, math competitions, taking care of sister, everything was just added together and became a lot to me. The following sections are some pieces inside this bunch of mess.

# English, or more specifically, college application

During these two years of studying in ORHS, my English has definitely improved a lot, but still has a lot of space to further improve. However, there are so many cases where I just have to be good at English, or, at least, pretend to. 

I took the SAT on August and October, just like most of my senior classmates who took it 2 or 3 times. The math section is pretty chill, but the English section is hell. The August after my summer camp ends was the start of the crazy college application season. A lot of information from everywhere, including my counselor, the Internet and social media, like "3.6 GPA is very bad", "if you don't have 100 volunteer hours you're cooked", "xxx had a paper published at an international conference but still got rejected from XXX University", made me feel like the start of a big race. Since I didn't have much to do at that time, my dad told me to just spend as much time as possible on SAT English. Driven by the craziness of everything, I started to practice. At that time I did around 100 SAT English multiple choice questions every day, and I made statistics about what I was weak in because that was the only relaxation from reviewing. Probably about 5 days before the August SAT, I couldn't control myself and started to play [florr.io](florr.io) after a bunch of practice. After playing for about an hour, I went back and did a practice test, and I did so bad at it. I started to panic and practiced more on the next 3 days, and eventually I improved 40 points.

I had a lot less time to practice for the October because school started and I also had to write college essays. I only have time for around 10-15 questions a day, but I improved much more on that test. With my essays joining in, writing them became almost the only thing I do after school and homework. Thinking of the quality of the essays determines whetehr I will get accepted, I was really stressful.  After two months of craziness, I submitted some schools for Early Action, and my workload has decreased a lot after that. I was able to do some other amusement activities such as studying physics and theory of computation and play tennis with friends, which I will go into details in the "Sports" section.

This place is a much better place for me to write than my college essay google docs or even English homework essays, because I don't need to care about the quality. In fact, I write this article with little deletion of text. But, anyway, using English was helpful.


# Math and other science Stuff

Math competitions are crazy, especially when you don't have much experience and time to prepare. I mean, I'm not in the training camp since elementary school. All I did for preparing the AMC was just 10 practice problems. There is some interesting problems from those practice problems such as "what is the product of all solutions to the equation

$$ \log_{7x} 2023 \cdot \log_{289x} 2023 =\log_{2023x} 2023 $$

"? (idk if that should be a ? or a . but anyway) The solution was just a change of base formula and Vieta's theorem, which was pretty chill, but I still tried it for a long time and didn't make it, which is embarrassing. There are also a bunch of other interesting problems that I wasn't able to do. The AMC came quickly, only 6 days after EA deadline. I completed it, and not expecting to go on to the next level, but that was the end of my high school math competition journey, so, yay. 

Anything that has something to do with math is just a relaxation for me from writing essays these months, and I hope I could do more of those while have more opportunities to hang out with friends. I don't know why, but reading theory of computation is one of my favorite relaxation activity from writing essays, except when it came to a part about proving why every DCFL is recognizable by a DPDA, so I skipped it, but the next section, Turing machine, was what I kinda like. Designing Turing machines is really stress relieving. I recommend trying it when you are stressed out.

I decided to continue participating in Science Olympiad club, and it sure has been super relaxing. I played some tennis with some of the teammates after the club activity on Thursday after school.

I actually forgot another thing about math: Multivariable Calculus. If I am writing a formal essay, I would move this paragraph to a paragraph above it. My comment about this class is everything was good except for the things that are not good. The reason why the cuvature rate formula looks like 

$$ \kappa = \left| \frac{d\overrightarrow{T}}{ds} \right| $$

was my favorite thing in the class, although neither the professor nor the TA mentioned about it. I'm quite excited that I will prove a theorem about electric flux in the future in this class because that's exactly what I'm studying in physics.
