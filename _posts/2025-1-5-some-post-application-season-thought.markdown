Happy new year.

Just finished my college app season.

Last night, I counted how many words of college essays I've written. The result was 16,603 words.

Looking back into the whole college app season, there were so many times that I pushed myself to the limit of writing. Sometimes the college result is a good motivation, but other time it's just telling the same story over and over again with different prompts.

The college app season is crazy, but at least the only good thing is that it makes me realize what a good therapy math is. Without a deadline, you can do whatever you want. The freedom of thinking is a great relaxation from stress.

I'm finally able to do more math that I want. Recently, I've just started a series of study guide ["From Trigonometry to Calculus II in a Semester"](mikemo2195054.github.io/trig-to-calc-speedrun), inspired by one of my classmates who claimed that he will study Trigonometry, Precalculus, Calculus I and Calculus II all in a semester. I need to write materials that high school students can understand and enjoy, but doing the work itself is also an enjoyment. I take care of my sister a lot, and although I'm far from a pro babysitter, I need to prepare mateirals that my sister enjoys a lot of times. i feel like these two things of mine are of the same principle: design something other poeple will enjoy, and I kinda like doing that.

The most important thing for teachers, tutors, parents, babysitters is to avoid confirmation bias. When you know a thing, you will forget what it looks like to someone who doesn't know the thing. All these four roles have the main task of avoiding such confirmation bias, and I hope they enjoy the process of imagining what things look like to someone who doesn't know.

Anyway, they're just random thoughts, but I enjoy writing them down.
